# Job Web Scraper

## Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to scrape job listings from different online job boards and consolidate them into a single, searchable interface. My goal was to lessen the amount of tab switching required when applying for jobs.

## Why I Built This
I built this project as the first step towards creating a larger, more complex application down the line. This served as my introduction to automated data collection and web backend development. By building this web application, I gained experience in handling unstructured data and presenting it through a functional web interface.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** The core language used for the scraping logic and backend.
* **Selenium:** Used to bypass bot detection and handle dynamic content.
* **Beautiful Soup:** Used to parse HTML and extract specific data points such as job titles, company names, locations, and application links.
* **Flask:** Used to build the web server and route the scraped data to the frontend for user viewing.
* **HTML/CSS/JS:** Used to design the dashboard and display the scraped results in a clean, interactive layout with filters.
